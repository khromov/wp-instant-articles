Instant Articles for WordPress dramatically improves user experience with significantly faster perceived site speed using DNS prefetching and page prerendering technologies. 

== Description ==

Instant Articles for WordPress will let you configure DNS prefetching URLs and will automatically prerender the last 2 posts on the front page, plus next and previous posts when viewing a single post.

It is not recommended to use more than 4-5 URLs for DNS prefetching.

Enabling page prerendering will likely increase server and client (browsers) load.

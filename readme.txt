WordPress Instant Articles dramatically improves user experience and site speed. Posts load instantly with page pre-render and DNS prefetch. 

== Description ==

Instant Articles for WordPress will let you configure DNS prefetching URLs and will automatically prerender the last 2 posts on the front page, plus next and previous posts when viewing a single post.

It is not recommended to use more than 4-5 URLs for DNS prefetching.

Enabling page prerendering will likely increase server and client (browsers) load.
